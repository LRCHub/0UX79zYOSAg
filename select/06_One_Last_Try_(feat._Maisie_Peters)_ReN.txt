掴みかけた途端 崩れ落ちた夢は
鋭く尖って 心を突き刺した
流した涙は まだ乾かぬまま
Keep holding on 耐えて holding on
すきを追いかけた
すきの見えない不安に怯えてた夜を超えて
君のその声が灯火に変わる
それは

始まりの合図 静かに待ち続けた sunrise
No one else can stop us now
This is our fun

One last try
もがいた日々も
One last try
生み出す力に変えて
滲んだ景色の先に
One last try
We never look back until the end

They'll never take me down not a fist without a fight (yeah)
Because I've worked too hard too far, not to cross the finish line
Running with uncertainty, moving down the long road (but not alone)
Heard your voice through all the noise, shining bright in the unknown (we're ready now)

Been waiting in the dark so long for what we thought would never come, sunrise
No one else can stop us now
This is our chance

One last try
Oh I don't wanna live in yesterday
One last try
'Cause I know that the goal's just one step away
Try harder the gray sky's as high as we can
One last try
We never look back until the end

Been waiting for this moment for a long time
No matter what they say, we keep our heads high
Been waiting for this moment for a long time
No matter what they say, we keep our heads high
Been waiting for this moment for a long time
No matter what they say, we keep our heads high
Been waiting for this moment for a long time
We're all united and we high

One last try
日々も
One last try
生み出す力に変えて
滲んだ景色の先に
One last try
答えはそこにあるさ
