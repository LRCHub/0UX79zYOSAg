Maisie, Maisie, Maisie, Maisie
Bad luck, bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
Maisie
His illuminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie, lay in the hall
With diamonds and emeralds

Maisie, Maisie
Bad luck, the bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
His illuminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie, lay in the hall
With diamonds and emeralds
And diamond brooch, beyond reproach
Bad luck, bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
Maisie
