You're bright and it's blinding
Just a small spark, and you're flying
With your wax wings in a back room
Got my arms out, tryna catch you
As you're fallin' through the ceiling
Took a big leap, now you're bleedin'
With a broke nose and a dumb smile
Pretty mugshot for your profile

Caught in a streetlight
A lost cause in Levi's
But I'll always see great heights in you

I'll be the last one
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one
Holdin' my hands up (hey)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one

If you're the Syd Barrett of the band, I'm the girl on the train tracks holdin' your hand
Halfway to the moon on a plane you couldn't land
But I'll believe in you, still your number one fan, baby
After the crowd's gone, I'll be the last one

You're a dreamer in a parka
Send a flare up in the dark
And I'll come find ya
Somewhere downtown
With your worst friends on the last round
Oh, oh

Caught in a streetlight
A lost cause in Levi's
But I'll always see great heights in you

And I'll be the last one (hey)
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one
Holdin' my hands up (hey)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one

If you're the Syd Barrett of the band, I'm the girl on the train tracks holdin' your hand
Halfway to the moon on a plane you couldn't land
But I'll believe in you, still your number one fan, baby
After the crowd's gone, I'll be the last one

When all the floodlights blow (oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
And the sky is filled with smoke (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
You're still out there on your own (oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
And I'm still the last to go

And I'll be the last one
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one)
Holdin' my hands up (hey) (holdin' my hands up)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one)

'Cause, if you're the Syd Barrett of the band
I'm the girl on the train tracks holdin' your hand (holdin' your hand)
Halfway to the moon on a plane you couldn't land (we're never gonna land)
You were seeing castles, they were seeing sand
They're never gonna get it, no, they'll never understand
But I believe in you, I'm your number one fan
So, after the crowd's gone (after the crowd's gone)
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one, ha)
